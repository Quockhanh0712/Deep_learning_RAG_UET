Additionally, the National Assembly plays a crucial role in representing the interests of the state and ensuring that the laws are enforced fairly and justly. It also oversees the organization and protection of the law, as well as punishing crimes committed against the state. Overall, the National Assembly serves as the legislative body of the country, making important decisions about the nation's laws and policies."

Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the term \"Government\" is used to refer to the authority or administration of a country or region, which may include legislative, executive, and judicial branches responsible for making laws, enforcing them, and interpreting them, respectively. In this case, the context suggests that the people's government is being referred to specifically, indicating that the Government is the governing body of the nation or state under discussion. Therefore, the definition of the Government in the Constitution would likely encompass these aspects of governance, including its structure, powers, and responsibilities. However, without more specific details from the full text of the Constitution, we cannot provide a precise definition."

For example, if there's a need to change certain citizenship rights for a longer period than specified in Point a of this clause, it would involve modifying the relevant section accordingly. This could include adding new clauses, deleting existing ones, or altering the wording of current provisions to reflect the desired amendments. Additionally, the process may require approval from both houses of parliament and adherence to constitutional procedures outlined in the document itself. It's important to note that such amendments must comply with legal standards set forth in the constitution to ensure fairness and transparency."

It mentions that anyone who abuses their position or power to commit certain acts may face legal action, including confiscation of property, fines, imprisonment, etc., depending on the severity of the offense. However, it does not explicitly state that \"all state power belongs\" to anyone. Therefore, the correct answer is that the passage does not provide information about who owns all state power."

It also refers to the executive branch of government, which implements these laws and regulations through various departments and agencies. In this context, it seems to be referring to the People's Government, which is the governmental structure established by the constitution of the country. The People's Government is responsible for making decisions, implementing policies, and ensuring the well-being of the nation. It is also referred to as the state authority, which has the power to enforce laws and regulations within the country. Additionally, the People's Government is accountable to the people, meaning that they are elected by the citizens and must answer to them for their actions. Therefore, the People's Government is the central authority of a country, responsible for maintaining law and order, protecting the rights and freedoms of its citizens, and promoting the welfare of the nation."
