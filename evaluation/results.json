The People's Government is responsible for making decisions, implementing policies, and ensuring the well-being of the nation. It is also referred to as the state authority, which has the power to enforce laws and regulations within the country. Additionally, the People's Government is accountable to the people, meaning that they are elected by the citizens and must answer to them for their actions.
