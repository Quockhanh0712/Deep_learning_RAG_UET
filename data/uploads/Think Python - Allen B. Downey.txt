Preface 
The strange history of this book 
In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low. 
One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces. 
Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were: • Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages. 
• Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and define each term at first use. 
• Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult topics and split them into a series of small steps. 
• Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest. 
I needed a title, so on a whim I chose How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. 
My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students practice. 
I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book. 
What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book. As Green Tea Press, I published the first Python version in 2001. 
In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the first time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.
vi Chapter 0. Preface 
Over the last nine years I continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some of the examples and adding material, especially exercises. 
The result is this book, now with the less grandiose title Think Python. Some of the changes are: 
• I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These sections present general techniques for finding and avoiding bugs, and warnings about Python pit falls. 
• I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to a few substantial projects. And I wrote solutions for most of them. 
• I added a series of case studies—longer examples with exercises, solutions, and discussion. Some are based on Swampy, a suite of Python programs I wrote for use in my classes. Swampy, code examples, and some solutions are available from http://thinkpython.com. 
• I expanded the discussion of program development plans and basic design patterns. 
• I added appendices about debugging, analysis of algorithms, and UML diagrams with Lumpy. 
I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think, at least a little bit, like a computer scientist.

Contributor List 
More than 100 sharp-eyed and thoughtful readers have sent in suggestions and corrections over the past few years. Their contributions, and enthusiasm for this project, have been a huge help. 
If you have a suggestion or correction, please send email to feedback@thinkpython.com. If I make a change based on your feedback, I will add you to the contributor list (unless you ask to be omitted). 
If you include at least part of the sentence the error appears in, that makes it easy for me to search. Page and section numbers are fine, too, but not quite as easy to work with. Thanks!

Chapter 1 
The way of the program 
The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of think ing combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifi cally computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into sys tems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behav ior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions. 
The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem solving. Problem solv ing means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That’s why this chapter is called, “The way of the program.” 
On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer. 
1.1 The Python programming language 
The programming language you will learn is Python. Python is an example of a high-level language; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C, C++, Perl, and Java. 
There are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as “machine languages” or “as sembly languages.” Loosely speaking, computers can only run programs written in low level languages. So programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. 
The advantages are enormous. First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modi fications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewrit ten to run on another.

OBJECT EXECUTOR CODE 
Figure 1.2: A compiler translates source code into object code, which is run by a hardware executor. 
Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. Low level languages are used only for a few specialized applications. 
Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters and compilers. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations. Figure 1.1 shows the structure of an interpreter. 
A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts run ning. In this context, the high-level program is called the source code, and the translated program is called the object code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation. Figure 1.2 shows the structure of a compiler. 
Python is considered an interpreted language because Python programs are executed by an interpreter. There are two ways to use the interpreter: interactive mode and script mode. In interactive mode, you type Python programs and the interpreter displays the result: >>> 1 + 1 
2 
The chevron, >>>, is the prompt the interpreter uses to indicate that it is ready. If you type 1 + 1, the interpreter replies 2. 
Alternatively, you can store code in a file and use the interpreter to execute the contents of the file, which is called a script. By convention, Python scripts have names that end with .py. 
To execute the script, you have to tell the interpreter the name of the file. If you have a script named dinsdale.py and you are working in a UNIX command window, you type python dinsdale.py. In other development environments, the details of executing scripts are different. You can find instructions for your environment at the Python website http: //python.org. 
Working in interactive mode is convenient for testing small pieces of code because you can type and execute them immediately. But for anything more than a few lines, you should save your code as a script so you can modify and execute it in the future.
1.2. What is a program? 3 1.2 What is a program? 
A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as search ing and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program. 
The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language: 
input: Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device. 
output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device. math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication. conditional execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code. repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation. 
Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like these. So you can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions. 
That may be a little vague, but we will come back to this topic when we talk about algo rithms. 
1.3 What is debugging? 
Programming is error-prone. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called bugs and the process of tracking them down is called debugging. 
Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic errors. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly. 
1.3.1 Syntax errors 
Python can only execute a program if the syntax is correct; otherwise, the interpreter dis plays an error message. Syntax refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so (1 + 2) is legal, but 8) is a syntax error. 
In English, readers can tolerate most syntax errors, which is why we can read the poetry of e. e. cummings without spewing error messages. Python is not so forgiving. If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your program, Python will display an error message and quit, and you will not be able to run your program. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and find them faster.
4 Chapter 1. The way of the program 1.3.2 Runtime errors 
The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until after the program has started running. These errors are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened. 
Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one. 
1.3.3 Semantic errors 
The third type of error is the semantic error. If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run successfully in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do. 
The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you wanted to write. The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong. Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing. 
1.3.4 Experimental debugging 
One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frus trating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of programming. 
In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues, and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see. 
Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea about what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, then you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes pointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however im probable, must be the truth.” (A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four) 
For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a program that does something and make small modifications, debugging them as you go, so that you always have a working program. 
For example, Linux is an operating system that contains thousands of lines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386 chip. According to Larry Greenfield, “One of Linus’s earlier projects was a program that would switch between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux.” (The Linux Users’ Guide Beta Version 1). 
Later chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other programming prac tices.
1.4. Formal and natural languages 5 1.4 Formal and natural languages 
Natural languages are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally. 
Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal lan guage to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly: 
Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations. 
Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example, 3 + 3 = 6 is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but 3+ = 3$6 is not. H2O is a syntactically correct chemical formula, but 2Zz is not. 
Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to tokens and structure. Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the problems with 3+ = 3$6 is that $ is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as I know). Similarly, 2Zz is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation Zz. 
The second type of syntax rule pertains to the structure of a statement; that is, the way the tokens are arranged. The statement 3+ = 3 is illegal because even though + and = are legal tokens, you can’t have one right after the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not before. 
Exercise 1.1. Write a well-structured English sentence with invalid tokens in it. Then write an other sentence with all valid tokens but with invalid structure. 
When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called parsing. 
For example, when you hear the sentence, “The penny dropped,” you understand that “the penny” is the subject and “dropped” is the predicate. Once you have parsed a sen tence, you can figure out what it means, or the semantics of the sentence. Assuming that you know what a penny is and what it means to drop, you will understand the general implication of this sentence. 
Although formal and natural languages have many features in common—tokens, struc ture, syntax, and semantics—there are some differences: 
ambiguity: Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using con textual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context. 
redundancy: In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.
6 Chapter 1. The way of the program 
literalness: Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If I say, “The penny dropped,” there is probably no penny and nothing dropping (this idiom means that someone realized something after a period of confusion). Formal languages mean exactly what they say. 
People who grow up speaking a natural language—everyone—often have a hard time ad justing to formal languages. In some ways, the difference between formal and natural language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so: 
Poetry: Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate. 
Prose: The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous. 
Programs: The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure. 
Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal languages). First, re member that formal languages are much more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is very important, so it is usually not a good idea to read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Small er rors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language. 
1.5 The first program 
Traditionally, the first program you write in a new language is called “Hello, World!” be cause all it does is display the words “Hello, World!”. In Python, it looks like this: 
print 'Hello, World!' 
This is an example of a print statement, which doesn’t actually print anything on paper. It displays a value on the screen. In this case, the result is the words 
Hello, World! 
The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the text to be dis played; they don’t appear in the result. 
In Python 3, the syntax for printing is slightly different: 
print('Hello, World!') 
The parentheses indicate that print is a function. We’ll get to functions in Chapter 3. 
For the rest of this book, I’ll use the print statement. If you are using Python 3, you will have to translate. But other than that, there are very few differences we have to worry about.
1.6. Debugging 7 1.6 Debugging 
It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can try out the examples as you go. You can run most of the examples in interactive mode, but if you put the code in a script, it is easier to try out variations. 
Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make mistakes. For example, in the “Hello, world!” program, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks? What if you leave out both? What if you spell print wrong? 
This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps with debugging, because you get to know what the error messages mean. It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later and accidentally. 
Programming, and especially debugging, sometimes brings out strong emotions. If you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, despondent or embarrassed. 
There is evidence that people naturally respond to computers as if they were people. When they work well, we think of them as teammates, and when they are obstinate or rude, we respond to them the same way we respond to rude, obstinate people (Reeves and Nass, The Media Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media Like Real People and Places). 
Preparing for these reactions might help you deal with them. One approach is to think of the computer as an employee with certain strengths, like speed and precision, and partic ular weaknesses, like lack of empathy and inability to grasp the big picture. 
Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage of the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses. And find ways to use your emotions to engage with the problem, without letting your reactions interfere with your ability to work effectively. 
Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill that is useful for many ac tivities beyond programming. At the end of each chapter there is a debugging section, like this one, with my thoughts about debugging. I hope they help!

Exercise 1.2. Use a web browser to go to the Python website http: // python. org . This page contains information about Python and links to Python-related pages, and it gives you the ability to search the Python documentation. 
For example, if you enter print in the search window, the first link that appears is the documenta tion of the print statement. At this point, not all of it will make sense to you, but it is good to know where it is. 
Exercise 1.3. Start the Python interpreter and type help() to start the online help utility. Or you can type help('print') to get information about the print statement. 
If this example doesn’t work, you may need to install additional Python documentation or set an environment variable; the details depend on your operating system and version of Python. Exercise 1.4. Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator. Python’s syntax for math operations is almost the same as standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols +, - and / denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect. The symbol for multiplication is *. 
If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your average time per mile? What is your average speed in miles per hour? (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).
10 Chapter 1. The way of the program
Chapter 2 
Variables, expressions and statements 
2.1 Values and types 
A value is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number. The values we have seen so far are 1, 2, and 'Hello, World!'. 
These values belong to different types: 2 is an integer, and 'Hello, World!' is a string, so-called because it contains a “string” of letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks. 
If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you. 
>>> type('Hello, World!') 
<type 'str'> 
>>> type(17) 
<type 'int'> 
Not surprisingly, strings belong to the type str and integers belong to the type int. Less obviously, numbers with a decimal point belong to a type called float, because these num bers are represented in a format called floating-point. 
>>> type(3.2) 
<type 'float'> 
What about values like '17' and '3.2'? They look like numbers, but they are in quotation marks like strings. 
>>> type('17') 
<type 'str'> 
>>> type('3.2') 
<type 'str'> 
They’re strings. 
When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of three digits, as in 1,000,000. This is not a legal integer in Python, but it is legal:
12 Chapter 2. Variables, expressions and statements 
’And now for something completely different’ 
17 
3.1415926535897932 
Figure 2.1: State diagram. 
>>> 1,000,000 
(1, 0, 0) 
message n 
pi 
Well, that’s not what we expected at all! Python interprets 1,000,000 as a comma separated sequence of integers. This is the first example we have seen of a semantic error: the code runs without producing an error message, but it doesn’t do the “right” thing. 
2.2 Variables 
One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value. 
An assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values: 
>>> message = 'And now for something completely different' >>> n = 17 
>>> pi = 3.1415926535897932 
This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string to a new variable named message; the second gives the integer 17 to n; the third assigns the (approximate) value of π to pi. 
A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing to the variable’s value. This kind of figure is called a state diagram because it shows what state each of the variables is in (think of it as the variable’s state of mind). Figure 2.1 shows the result of the previous example. 
The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to. 
>>> type(message) 
<type 'str'> 
>>> type(n) 
<type 'int'> 
>>> type(pi) 
<type 'float'> 
2.3 Variable names and keywords 
Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful—they docu ment what the variable is used for. 
Variable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they have to begin with a letter. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is a good idea to begin variable names with a lowercase letter (you’ll see why later).
2.4. Operators and operands 13 
The underscore character, _, can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as my_name or airspeed_of_unladen_swallow. 
If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error: 
>>> 76trombones = 'big parade' 
SyntaxError: invalid syntax 
>>> more@ = 1000000 
SyntaxError: invalid syntax 
>>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy' 
SyntaxError: invalid syntax 
76trombones is illegal because it does not begin with a letter. more@ is illegal because it contains an illegal character, @. But what’s wrong with class? 
It turns out that class is one of Python’s keywords. The interpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program, and they cannot be used as variable names. 
Python 2 has 31 keywords: 
and del from not while 
as elif global or with 
assert else if pass yield 
break except import print 
class exec in raise 
continue finally is return 
def for lambda try 
In Python 3, exec is no longer a keyword, but nonlocal is. 
You might want to keep this list handy. If the interpreter complains about one of your variable names and you don’t know why, see if it is on this list. 
2.4 Operators and operands 
Operators are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplica tion. The values the operator is applied to are called operands. 
The operators +, -, *, / and ** perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation, as in the following examples: 
20+32 hour-1 hour*60+minute minute/60 5**2 (5+9)*(15-7) 
In some other languages, ^ is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator called XOR. I won’t cover bitwise operators in this book, but you can read about them at http://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators. 
In Python 2, the division operator might not do what you expect: 
>>> minute = 59 
>>> minute/60 
0 
The value of minute is 59, and in conventional arithmetic 59 divided by 60 is 0.98333, not 0. The reason for the discrepancy is that Python is performing floor division. When both of the operands are integers, the result is also an integer; floor division chops off the fraction part, so in this example it rounds down to zero.
14 Chapter 2. Variables, expressions and statements 
In Python 3, the result of this division is a float. The new operator // performs floor division. 
If either of the operands is a floating-point number, Python performs floating-point divi sion, and the result is a float: 
>>> minute/60.0 
0.98333333333333328 
2.5 Expressions and statements 
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions (assuming that the variable x has been assigned a value): 
17 
x 
x + 17 
A statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two kinds of statement: print and assignment. 
Technically an expression is also a statement, but it is probably simpler to think of them as different things. The important difference is that an expression has a value; a statement does not. 
2.6 Interactive mode and script mode 
One of the benefits of working with an interpreted language is that you can test bits of code in interactive mode before you put them in a script. But there are differences between interactive mode and script mode that can be confusing. 
For example, if you are using Python as a calculator, you might type 
>>> miles = 26.2 
>>> miles * 1.61 
42.182 
The first line assigns a value to miles, but it has no visible effect. The second line is an ex pression, so the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result. So we learn that a marathon is about 42 kilometers. 
But if you type the same code into a script and run it, you get no output at all. In script mode an expression, all by itself, has no visible effect. Python actually evaluates the ex pression, but it doesn’t display the value unless you tell it to: 
miles = 26.2 
print miles * 1.61 
This behavior can be confusing at first. 
A script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute. 
For example, the script
2.7. Order of operations 15 
print 1 
x = 2 
print x 
produces the output 
1 
2 
The assignment statement produces no output. 
Exercise 2.1. Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see what they do: 
5 
x = 5 
x + 1 
Now put the same statements into a script and run it. What is the output? Modify the script by transforming each expression into a print statement and then run it again. 
2.7 Order of operations 
When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends on the rules of precedence. For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the rules: 
• Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, 2 * (3-1) is 4, and (1+1)**(5-2) is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even if it doesn’t change the result. 
• Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so 2**1+1 is 3, not 4, and 3*1**3 is 3, not 27. 
• Multiplication and Division have the same precedence, which is higher than Addition and Subtraction, which also have the same precedence. So 2*3-1 is 5, not 4, and 6+4/2 is 8, not 5. 
• Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponen tiation). So in the expression degrees / 2 * pi, the division happens first and the result is multiplied by pi. To divide by 2π, you can use parentheses or write degrees / 2 / pi. 
I don’t work very hard to remember rules of precedence for other operators. If I can’t tell by looking at the expression, I use parentheses to make it obvious. 
2.8 String operations 
In general, you can’t perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look like numbers, so the following are illegal: 
'2'-'1' 'eggs'/'easy' 'third'*'a charm'
16 Chapter 2. Variables, expressions and statements 
The + operator works with strings, but it might not do what you expect: it performs con catenation, which means joining the strings by linking them end-to-end. For example: first = 'throat' 
second = 'warbler' 
print first + second 
The output of this program is throatwarbler. 
The * operator also works on strings; it performs repetition. For example, 'Spam'*3 is 'SpamSpamSpam'. If one of the operands is a string, the other has to be an integer. 
This use of + and * makes sense by analogy with addition and multiplication. Just as 4*3 is equivalent to 4+4+4, we expect 'Spam'*3 to be the same as 'Spam'+'Spam'+'Spam', and it is. On the other hand, there is a significant way in which string concatenation and repe tition are different from integer addition and multiplication. Can you think of a property that addition has that string concatenation does not? 
2.9 Comments 
As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why. 
For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural lan guage what the program is doing. These notes are called comments, and they start with the # symbol: 
# compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed 
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60 
In this case, the comment appears on a line by itself. You can also put comments at the end of a line: 
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60 # percentage of an hour Everything from the # to the end of the line is ignored—it has no effect on the program. 
Comments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of the code. It is reasonable to assume that the reader can figure out what the code does; it is much more useful to explain why. 
This comment is redundant with the code and useless: 
v = 5 # assign 5 to v 
This comment contains useful information that is not in the code: 
v = 5 # velocity in meters/second. 
Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but long names can make com plex expressions hard to read, so there is a tradeoff. 
2.10 Debugging 
At this point the syntax error you are most likely to make is an illegal variable name, like class and yield, which are keywords, or odd~job and US$, which contain illegal charac ters.
2.11. Glossary 17 
If you put a space in a variable name, Python thinks it is two operands without an operator: 
>>> bad name = 5 
SyntaxError: invalid syntax 
For syntax errors, the error messages don’t help much. The most common messages are SyntaxError: invalid syntax and SyntaxError: invalid token, neither of which is very informative. 
The runtime error you are most likely to make is a “use before def;” that is, trying to use a variable before you have assigned a value. This can happen if you spell a variable name wrong: 
>>> principal = 327.68 
>>> interest = principle * rate 
NameError: name 'principle' is not defined 
Variables names are case sensitive, so LaTeX is not the same as latex. 
At this point the most likely cause of a semantic error is the order of operations. For exam ple, to evaluate 12π, you might be tempted to write 
>>> 1.0 / 2.0 * pi 
But the division happens first, so you would get π/2, which is not the same thing! There is no way for Python to know what you meant to write, so in this case you don’t get an error message; you just get the wrong answer.

Functions 
3.1 Function calls 
In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can “call” the function by name. We have already seen one example of a function call: 
>>> type(32) 
<type 'int'> 
The name of the function is type. The expression in parentheses is called the argument of the function. The result, for this function, is the type of the argument. 
It is common to say that a function “takes” an argument and “returns” a result. The result is called the return value. 
3.2 Type conversion functions 
Python provides built-in functions that convert values from one type to another. The int function takes any value and converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise: 
>>> int('32') 
32 
>>> int('Hello') 
ValueError: invalid literal for int(): Hello 
int can convert floating-point values to integers, but it doesn’t round off; it chops off the fraction part: 
>>> int(3.99999) 
3 
>>> int(-2.3) 
-2 
float converts integers and strings to floating-point numbers:
20 Chapter 3. Functions 
>>> float(32) 
32.0 
>>> float('3.14159') 
3.14159 
Finally, str converts its argument to a string: 
>>> str(32) 
'32' 
>>> str(3.14159) 
'3.14159' 
3.3 Math functions 
Python has a math module that provides most of the familiar mathematical functions. A module is a file that contains a collection of related functions. 
Before we can use the module, we have to import it: 
>>> import math 
This statement creates a module object named math. If you print the module object, you get some information about it: 
>>> print math 
<module 'math' (built-in)> 
The module object contains the functions and variables defined in the module. To access one of the functions, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called dot notation. 
>>> ratio = signal_power / noise_power 
>>> decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio) 
>>> radians = 0.7 
>>> height = math.sin(radians) 
The first example uses log10 to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels (assuming that signal_power and noise_power are defined). The math module also provides log, which computes logarithms base e. 
The second example finds the sine of radians. The name of the variable is a hint that sin and the other trigonometric functions (cos, tan, etc.) take arguments in radians. To convert from degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply by 2π: 
>>> degrees = 45 
>>> radians = degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi 
>>> math.sin(radians) 
0.707106781187 
The expression math.pi gets the variable pi from the math module. The value of this variable is an approximation of π, accurate to about 15 digits. 
If you know your trigonometry, you can check the previous result by comparing it to the square root of two divided by two: 
>>> math.sqrt(2) / 2.0 
0.707106781187
3.4. Composition 21 3.4 Composition 
So far, we have looked at the elements of a program—variables, expressions, and statements—in isolation, without talking about how to combine them. 
One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small building blocks and compose them. For example, the argument of a function can be any kind of expression, including arithmetic operators: 
x = math.sin(degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi) 
And even function calls: 
x = math.exp(math.log(x+1)) 
Almost anywhere you can put a value, you can put an arbitrary expression, with one ex ception: the left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable name. Any other expression on the left side is a syntax error (we will see exceptions to this rule later). 
>>> minutes = hours * 60 # right 
>>> hours * 60 = minutes # wrong! 
SyntaxError: can't assign to operator 
3.5 Adding new functions 
So far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but it is also possible to add new functions. A function definition specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called. 
Here is an example: 
def print_lyrics(): 
print "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay." 
print "I sleep all night and I work all day." 
def is a keyword that indicates that this is a function definition. The name of the function is print_lyrics. The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the first character can’t be a number. You can’t use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name. 
The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn’t take any argu ments. 
The first line of the function definition is called the header; the rest is called the body. The header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, the indentation is always four spaces (see Section 3.14). The body can contain any number of statements. 
The strings in the print statements are enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes and double quotes do the same thing; most people use single quotes except in cases like this where a single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string. 
If you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints ellipses (...) to let you know that the definition isn’t complete:
22 Chapter 3. Functions 
>>> def print_lyrics(): 
... print "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay." 
... print "I sleep all night and I work all day." 
... 
To end the function, you have to enter an empty line (this is not necessary in a script). 
Defining a function creates a variable with the same name. 
>>> print print_lyrics 
<function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c> 
>>> type(print_lyrics) 
<type 'function'> 
The value of print_lyrics is a function object, which has type 'function'. 
The syntax for calling the new function is the same as for built-in functions: >>> print_lyrics() 
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay. 
I sleep all night and I work all day. 
Once you have defined a function, you can use it inside another function. For example, to repeat the previous refrain, we could write a function called repeat_lyrics: def repeat_lyrics(): 
print_lyrics() 
print_lyrics() 
And then call repeat_lyrics: 
>>> repeat_lyrics() 
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay. 
I sleep all night and I work all day. 
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay. 
I sleep all night and I work all day. 
But that’s not really how the song goes. 
3.6 Definitions and uses 
Pulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the whole program looks like this: 
def print_lyrics(): 
print "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay." 
print "I sleep all night and I work all day." 
def repeat_lyrics(): 
print_lyrics() 
print_lyrics() 
repeat_lyrics() 
This program contains two function definitions: print_lyrics and repeat_lyrics. Func tion definitions get executed just like other statements, but the effect is to create function objects. The statements inside the function do not get executed until the function is called, and the function definition generates no output.
3.7. Flow of execution 23 
As you might expect, you have to create a function before you can execute it. In other words, the function definition has to be executed before the first time it is called. Exercise 3.1. Move the last line of this program to the top, so the function call appears before the definitions. Run the program and see what error message you get. 
Exercise 3.2. Move the function call back to the bottom and move the definition of print_lyrics after the definition of repeat_lyrics. What happens when you run this program? 
3.7 Flow of execution 
In order to ensure that a function is defined before its first use, you have to know the order in which statements are executed, which is called the flow of execution. 
Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom. 
Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called. 
A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next state ment, the flow jumps to the body of the function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off. 
That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another function. But while executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet another function! 
Fortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function com pletes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates. 
What’s the moral of this sordid tale? When you read a program, you don’t always want to read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes more sense if you follow the flow of execution. 
3.8 Parameters and arguments 
Some of the built-in functions we have seen require arguments. For example, when you call math.sin you pass a number as an argument. Some functions take more than one argument: math.pow takes two, the base and the exponent. 
Inside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called parameters. Here is an example of a user-defined function that takes an argument: 
def print_twice(bruce): 
print bruce 
print bruce 
This function assigns the argument to a parameter named bruce. When the function is called, it prints the value of the parameter (whatever it is) twice. 
This function works with any value that can be printed.
24 Chapter 3. Functions 
>>> print_twice('Spam') 
Spam 
Spam 
>>> print_twice(17) 
17 
17 
>>> print_twice(math.pi) 
3.14159265359 
3.14159265359 
The same rules of composition that apply to built-in functions also apply to user-defined functions, so we can use any kind of expression as an argument for print_twice: >>> print_twice('Spam '*4) 
Spam Spam Spam Spam 
Spam Spam Spam Spam 
>>> print_twice(math.cos(math.pi)) 
-1.0 
-1.0 
The argument is evaluated before the function is called, so in the examples the expressions 'Spam '*4 and math.cos(math.pi) are only evaluated once. 
You can also use a variable as an argument: 
>>> michael = 'Eric, the half a bee.' 
>>> print_twice(michael) 
Eric, the half a bee. 
Eric, the half a bee. 
The name of the variable we pass as an argument (michael) has nothing to do with the name of the parameter (bruce). It doesn’t matter what the value was called back home (in the caller); here in print_twice, we call everybody bruce. 
3.9 Variables and parameters are local 
When you create a variable inside a function, it is local, which means that it only exists inside the function. For example: 
def cat_twice(part1, part2): 
cat = part1 + part2 
print_twice(cat) 
This function takes two arguments, concatenates them, and prints the result twice. Here is an example that uses it: 
>>> line1 = 'Bing tiddle ' 
>>> line2 = 'tiddle bang.' 
>>> cat_twice(line1, line2) 
Bing tiddle tiddle bang. 
Bing tiddle tiddle bang. 
When cat_twice terminates, the variable cat is destroyed. If we try to print it, we get an exception: 
>>> print cat 
NameError: name 'cat' is not defined
3.10. Stack diagrams 25 
<module> 
line1 
’Bing tiddle ’ 
line2 ’tiddle bang.’ 
cat_twice print_twice 
part1 part2 cat 
bruce 
’Bing tiddle ’ 
’tiddle bang.’ 
’Bing tiddle tiddle bang.’ ’Bing tiddle tiddle bang.’ 
Figure 3.1: Stack diagram. 
Parameters are also local. For example, outside print_twice, there is no such thing as bruce. 
3.10 Stack diagrams 
To keep track of which variables can be used where, it is sometimes useful to draw a stack diagram. Like state diagrams, stack diagrams show the value of each variable, but they also show the function each variable belongs to. 
Each function is represented by a frame. A frame is a box with the name of a function beside it and the parameters and variables of the function inside it. The stack diagram for the previous example is shown in Figure 3.1. 
The frames are arranged in a stack that indicates which function called which, and so on. In this example, print_twice was called by cat_twice, and cat_twice was called by __main__, which is a special name for the topmost frame. When you create a variable outside of any function, it belongs to __main__. 
Each parameter refers to the same value as its corresponding argument. So, part1 has the same value as line1, part2 has the same value as line2, and bruce has the same value as cat. 
If an error occurs during a function call, Python prints the name of the function, and the name of the function that called it, and the name of the function that called that, all the way back to __main__. 
For example, if you try to access cat from within print_twice, you get a NameError: Traceback (innermost last): 
File "test.py", line 13, in __main__ 
cat_twice(line1, line2) 
File "test.py", line 5, in cat_twice 
print_twice(cat) 
File "test.py", line 9, in print_twice 
print cat 
NameError: name 'cat' is not defined 
This list of functions is called a traceback. It tells you what program file the error occurred in, and what line, and what functions were executing at the time. It also shows the line of code that caused the error.
26 Chapter 3. Functions 
The order of the functions in the traceback is the same as the order of the frames in the stack diagram. The function that is currently running is at the bottom. 
3.11 Fruitful functions and void functions 
Some of the functions we are using, such as the math functions, yield results; for lack of a better name, I call them fruitful functions. Other functions, like print_twice, perform an action but don’t return a value. They are called void functions. 
When you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do something with the result; for example, you might assign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression: 
x = math.cos(radians) 
golden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2 
When you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays the result: 
>>> math.sqrt(5) 
2.2360679774997898 
But in a script, if you call a fruitful function all by itself, the return value is lost forever! math.sqrt(5) 
This script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn’t store or display the result, it is not very useful. 
Void functions might display something on the screen or have some other effect, but they don’t have a return value. If you try to assign the result to a variable, you get a special value called None. 
>>> result = print_twice('Bing') 
Bing 
Bing 
>>> print result 
None 
The value None is not the same as the string 'None'. It is a special value that has its own type: 
>>> print type(None) 
<type 'NoneType'> 
The functions we have written so far are all void. We will start writing fruitful functions in a few chapters. 
3.12 Why functions? 
It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions. There are several reasons: 
• Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug. 
• Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.
3.13. Importing with from 27 
• Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole. 
• Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it. 
3.13 Importing with from 
Python provides two ways to import modules; we have already seen one: >>> import math 
>>> print math 
<module 'math' (built-in)> 
>>> print math.pi 
3.14159265359 
If you import math, you get a module object named math. The module object contains constants like pi and functions like sin and exp. 
But if you try to access pi directly, you get an error. 
>>> print pi 
Traceback (most recent call last): 
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> 
NameError: name 'pi' is not defined 
As an alternative, you can import an object from a module like this: 
>>> from math import pi 
Now you can access pi directly, without dot notation. 
>>> print pi 
3.14159265359 
Or you can use the star operator to import everything from the module: >>> from math import * 
>>> cos(pi) 
-1.0 
The advantage of importing everything from the math module is that your code can be more concise. The disadvantage is that there might be conflicts between names defined in different modules, or between a name from a module and one of your variables. 
3.14 Debugging 
If you are using a text editor to write your scripts, you might run into problems with spaces and tabs. The best way to avoid these problems is to use spaces exclusively (no tabs). Most text editors that know about Python do this by default, but some don’t. 
Tabs and spaces are usually invisible, which makes them hard to debug, so try to find an editor that manages indentation for you. 
Also, don’t forget to save your program before you run it. Some development environ ments do this automatically, but some don’t. In that case the program you are looking at in the text editor is not the same as the program you are running.
28 Chapter 3. Functions 
Debugging can take a long time if you keep running the same, incorrect, program over and over! 
Make sure that the code you are looking at is the code you are running. If you’re not sure, put something like print 'hello' at the beginning of the program and run it again. If you don’t see hello, you’re not running the right program!

3.16 Exercises 
Exercise 3.3. Python provides a built-in function called len that returns the length of a string, so the value of len('allen') is 5. 
Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display. 
>>> right_justify('allen') 
allen 
Exercise 3.4. A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice: 
def do_twice(f): 
f() 
f() 
Here’s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice. 
def print_spam(): 
print 'spam' 
do_twice(print_spam) 
1. Type this example into a script and test it. 
2. Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value, and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument. 
3. Write a more general version of print_spam, called print_twice, that takes a string as a parameter and prints it twice. 
4. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an argument. 
5. Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements in the body of this function, not four. 
Solution: http: // thinkpython. com/ code/ do_ four. py . 
Exercise 3.5. This exercise can be done using only the statements and other features we have learned so far. 
1. Write a function that draws a grid like the following:
30 Chapter 3. Functions

+ - - - - + - - - - + 
Hint: to print more than one value on a line, you can print a comma-separated sequence: print '+', '-' 
If the sequence ends with a comma, Python leaves the line unfinished, so the value printed next appears on the same line. 
print '+', 
print '-' 
The output of these statements is '+ -'. 
A print statement all by itself ends the current line and goes to the next line. 2. Write a function that draws a similar grid with four rows and four columns. 
Solution: http: // thinkpython. com/ code/ grid. py . Credit: This exercise is based on an exercise in Oualline, Practical C Programming, Third Edition, O’Reilly Media, 1997.
Chapter 4 
Case study: interface design 
Code examples from this chapter are available from http://thinkpython.com/code/ polygon.py. 
4.1 TurtleWorld 
To accompany this book, I have written a package called Swampy. You can download Swampy from http://thinkpython.com/swampy; follow the instructions there to install Swampy on your system. 
A package is a collection of modules; one of the modules in Swampy is TurtleWorld, which provides a set of functions for drawing lines by steering turtles around the screen. 
If Swampy is installed as a package on your system, you can import TurtleWorld like this: from swampy.TurtleWorld import * 
If you downloaded the Swampy modules but did not install them as a package, you can ei ther work in the directory that contains the Swampy files, or add that directory to Python’s search path. Then you can import TurtleWorld like this: 
from TurtleWorld import * 
The details of the installation process and setting Python’s search path depend on your system, so rather than include those details here, I will try to maintain current information for several systems at http://thinkpython.com/swampy 
Create a file named mypolygon.py and type in the following code: 
from swampy.TurtleWorld import * 
world = TurtleWorld() 
bob = Turtle() 
print bob 
wait_for_user()
32 Chapter 4. Case study: interface design 
The first line imports everything from the TurtleWorld module in the swampy package. 
The next lines create a TurtleWorld assigned to world and a Turtle assigned to bob. Printing bob yields something like: 
<TurtleWorld.Turtle instance at 0xb7bfbf4c> 
This means that bob refers to an instance of a Turtle as defined in module TurtleWorld. In this context, “instance” means a member of a set; this Turtle is one of the set of possible Turtles. 
wait_for_user tells TurtleWorld to wait for the user to do something, although in this case there’s not much for the user to do except close the window. 
TurtleWorld provides several turtle-steering functions: fd and bk for forward and back ward, and lt and rt for left and right turns. Also, each Turtle is holding a pen, which is either down or up; if the pen is down, the Turtle leaves a trail when it moves. The functions pu and pd stand for “pen up” and “pen down.” 
To draw a right angle, add these lines to the program (after creating bob and before calling wait_for_user): 
fd(bob, 100) 
lt(bob) 
fd(bob, 100) 
The first line tells bob to take 100 steps forward. The second line tells him to turn left. 
When you run this program, you should see bob move east and then north, leaving two line segments behind. 
Now modify the program to draw a square. Don’t go on until you’ve got it working! 
4.2 Simple repetition 
Chances are you wrote something like this (leaving out the code that creates TurtleWorld and waits for the user): 
fd(bob, 100) 
lt(bob) 
fd(bob, 100) 
lt(bob) 
fd(bob, 100) 
lt(bob) 
fd(bob, 100) 
We can do the same thing more concisely with a for statement. Add this example to mypolygon.py and run it again: 
for i in range(4): 
print 'Hello!' 
You should see something like this:
4.3. Exercises 33 
Hello! 
Hello! 
Hello! 
Hello! 
This is the simplest use of the for statement; we will see more later. But that should be enough to let you rewrite your square-drawing program. Don’t go on until you do. 
Here is a for statement that draws a square: 
for i in range(4): 
fd(bob, 100) 
lt(bob) 
The syntax of a for statement is similar to a function definition. It has a header that ends with a colon and an indented body. The body can contain any number of statements. 
A for statement is sometimes called a loop because the flow of execution runs through the body and then loops back to the top. In this case, it runs the body four times. 
This version is actually a little different from the previous square-drawing code because it makes another turn after drawing the last side of the square. The extra turn takes a little more time, but it simplifies the code if we do the same thing every time through the loop. This version also has the effect of leaving the turtle back in the starting position, facing in the starting direction. 
4.3 Exercises 
The following is a series of exercises using TurtleWorld. They are meant to be fun, but they have a point, too. While you are working on them, think about what the point is. 
The following sections have solutions to the exercises, so don’t look until you have finished (or at least tried). 
1. Write a function called square that takes a parameter named t, which is a turtle. It should use the turtle to draw a square. 
Write a function call that passes bob as an argument to square, and then run the program again. 
2. Add another parameter, named length, to square. Modify the body so length of the sides is length, and then modify the function call to provide a second argument. Run the program again. Test your program with a range of values for length. 
3. The functions lt and rt make 90-degree turns by default, but you can provide a second argument that specifies the number of degrees. For example, lt(bob, 45) turns bob 45 degrees to the left. 
Make a copy of square and change the name to polygon. Add another parameter named n and modify the body so it draws an n-sided regular polygon. Hint: The exterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are 360/n degrees. 
4. Write a function called circle that takes a turtle, t, and radius, r, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by invoking polygon with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of r.
34 Chapter 4. Case study: interface design 
Hint: figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that length * n = circumference. 
Another hint: if bob is too slow for you, you can speed him up by changing bob.delay, which is the time between moves, in seconds. bob.delay = 0.01 ought to get him moving. 
5. Make a more general version of circle called arc that takes an additional parameter angle, which determines what fraction of a circle to draw. angle is in units of degrees, so when angle=360, arc should draw a complete circle. 
4.4 Encapsulation 
The first exercise asks you to put your square-drawing code into a function definition and then call the function, passing the turtle as a parameter. Here is a solution: 
def square(t): 
for i in range(4): 
fd(t, 100) 
lt(t) 
square(bob) 
The innermost statements, fd and lt are indented twice to show that they are inside the for loop, which is inside the function definition. The next line, square(bob), is flush with the left margin, so that is the end of both the for loop and the function definition. 
Inside the function, t refers to the same turtle bob refers to, so lt(t) has the same effect as lt(bob). So why not call the parameter bob? The idea is that t can be any turtle, not just bob, so you could create a second turtle and pass it as an argument to square: 
ray = Turtle() 
square(ray) 
Wrapping a piece of code up in a function is called encapsulation. One of the benefits of encapsulation is that it attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documenta tion. Another advantage is that if you re-use the code, it is more concise to call a function twice than to copy and paste the body! 
4.5 Generalization 
The next step is to add a length parameter to square. Here is a solution: 
def square(t, length): 
for i in range(4): 
fd(t, length) 
lt(t) 
square(bob, 100) 
Adding a parameter to a function is called generalization because it makes the function more general: in the previous version, the square is always the same size; in this version it can be any size.
4.6. Interface design 35 
The next step is also a generalization. Instead of drawing squares, polygon draws regular polygons with any number of sides. Here is a solution :rule 
def polygon(t, n, length): 
angle = 360.0 / n 
for i in range(n): 
fd(t, length) 
lt(t, angle) 
polygon(bob, 7, 70) 
This draws a 7-sided polygon with side length 70. If you have more than a few numeric arguments, it is easy to forget what they are, or what order they should be in. It is legal, and sometimes helpful, to include the names of the parameters in the argument list: polygon(bob, n=7, length=70) 
These are called keyword arguments because they include the parameter names as “key words” (not to be confused with Python keywords like while and def). 
This syntax makes the program more readable. It is also a reminder about how arguments and parameters work: when you call a function, the arguments are assigned to the param eters. 
4.6 Interface design 
The next step is to write circle, which takes a radius, r, as a parameter. Here is a simple solution that uses polygon to draw a 50-sided polygon: 
def circle(t, r): 
circumference = 2 * math.pi * r 
n = 50 
length = circumference / n 
polygon(t, n, length) 
The first line computes the circumference of a circle with radius r using the formula 2πr. Since we use math.pi, we have to import math. By convention, import statements are usually at the beginning of the script. 
n is the number of line segments in our approximation of a circle, so length is the length of each segment. Thus, polygon draws a 50-sides polygon that approximates a circle with radius r. 
One limitation of this solution is that n is a constant, which means that for very big circles, the line segments are too long, and for small circles, we waste time drawing very small segments. One solution would be to generalize the function by taking n as a parameter. This would give the user (whoever calls circle) more control, but the interface would be less clean. 
The interface of a function is a summary of how it is used: what are the parameters? What does the function do? And what is the return value? An interface is “clean” if it is “as simple as possible, but not simpler. (Einstein)” 
In this example, r belongs in the interface because it specifies the circle to be drawn. n is less appropriate because it pertains to the details of how the circle should be rendered.
36 Chapter 4. Case study: interface design 
Rather than clutter up the interface, it is better to choose an appropriate value of n depend ing on circumference: 
def circle(t, r): 
circumference = 2 * math.pi * r 
n = int(circumference / 3) + 1 
length = circumference / n 
polygon(t, n, length) 
Now the number of segments is (approximately) circumference/3, so the length of each segment is (approximately) 3, which is small enough that the circles look good, but big enough to be efficient, and appropriate for any size circle. 
4.7 Refactoring 
When I wrote circle, I was able to re-use polygon because a many-sided polygon is a good approximation of a circle. But arc is not as cooperative; we can’t use polygon or circle to draw an arc. 
One alternative is to start with a copy of polygon and transform it into arc. The result might look like this: 
def arc(t, r, angle): 
arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360 
n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1 
step_length = arc_length / n 
step_angle = float(angle) / n 
for i in range(n): 
fd(t, step_length) 
lt(t, step_angle) 
The second half of this function looks like polygon, but we can’t re-use polygon without changing the interface. We could generalize polygon to take an angle as a third argument, but then polygon would no longer be an appropriate name! Instead, let’s call the more general function polyline: 
def polyline(t, n, length, angle): 
for i in range(n): 
fd(t, length) 
lt(t, angle) 
Now we can rewrite polygon and arc to use polyline: 
def polygon(t, n, length): 
angle = 360.0 / n 
polyline(t, n, length, angle) 
def arc(t, r, angle): 
arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360 
n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1 
step_length = arc_length / n 
step_angle = float(angle) / n 
polyline(t, n, step_length, step_angle)
4.8. A development plan 37 
Finally, we can rewrite circle to use arc: 
def circle(t, r): 
arc(t, r, 360) 
This process—rearranging a program to improve function interfaces and facilitate code re use—is called refactoring. In this case, we noticed that there was similar code in arc and polygon, so we “factored it out” into polyline. 
If we had planned ahead, we might have written polyline first and avoided refactoring, but often you don’t know enough at the beginning of a project to design all the interfaces. Once you start coding, you understand the problem better. Sometimes refactoring is a sign that you have learned something. 
4.8 A development plan 
A development plan is a process for writing programs. The process we used in this case study is “encapsulation and generalization.” The steps of this process are: 
1. Start by writing a small program with no function definitions. 
2. Once you get the program working, encapsulate it in a function and give it a name. 3. Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters. 
4. Repeat steps 1–3 until you have a set of working functions. Copy and paste working code to avoid retyping (and re-debugging). 
5. Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For example, if you have similar code in several places, consider factoring it into an appropriately general function. 
This process has some drawbacks—we will see alternatives later—but it can be useful if you don’t know ahead of time how to divide the program into functions. This approach lets you design as you go along. 
4.9 docstring 
A docstring is a string at the beginning of a function that explains the interface (“doc” is short for “documentation”). Here is an example: 
def polyline(t, n, length, angle): 
"""Draws n line segments with the given length and 
angle (in degrees) between them. t is a turtle. 
""" 
for i in range(n): 
fd(t, length) 
lt(t, angle)
38 Chapter 4. Case study: interface design 
This docstring is a triple-quoted string, also known as a multiline string because the triple quotes allow the string to span more than one line. 
It is terse, but it contains the essential information someone would need to use this func tion. It explains concisely what the function does (without getting into the details of how it does it). It explains what effect each parameter has on the behavior of the function and what type each parameter should be (if it is not obvious). 
Writing this kind of documentation is an important part of interface design. A well designed interface should be simple to explain; if you are having a hard time explaining one of your functions, that might be a sign that the interface could be improved. 
4.10 Debugging 
An interface is like a contract between a function and a caller. The caller agrees to provide certain parameters and the function agrees to do certain work. 
For example, polyline requires four arguments: t has to be a Turtle; n is the number of line segments, so it has to be an integer; length should be a positive number; and angle has to be a number, which is understood to be in degrees. 
These requirements are called preconditions because they are supposed to be true before the function starts executing. Conversely, conditions at the end of the function are post conditions. Postconditions include the intended effect of the function (like drawing line segments) and any side effects (like moving the Turtle or making other changes in the World). 
Preconditions are the responsibility of the caller. If the caller violates a (properly docu mented!) precondition and the function doesn’t work correctly, the bug is in the caller, not the function.

Chapter 5 
Conditionals and recursion 
5.1 Modulus operator 
The modulus operator works on integers and yields the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second. In Python, the modulus operator is a percent sign (%). The syntax is the same as for other operators: 
>>> quotient = 7 / 3 
>>> print quotient 
2 
>>> remainder = 7 % 3 
>>> print remainder 
1 
So 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over. 
The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you can check whether one number is divisible by another—if x % y is zero, then x is divisible by y. 
Also, you can extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. For example, x % 10 yields the right-most digit of x (in base 10). Similarly x % 100 yields the last two digits. 
5.2 Boolean expressions 
A boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false. The following examples use the operator ==, which compares two operands and produces True if they are equal and False otherwise: 
>>> 5 == 5 
True 
>>> 5 == 6 
False 
True and False are special values that belong to the type bool; they are not strings: >>> type(True) 
<type 'bool'> 
>>> type(False) 
<type 'bool'>
42 Chapter 5. Conditionals and recursion 
The == operator is one of the relational operators; the others are: 
x != y # x is not equal to y 
x > y # x is greater than y 
x < y # x is less than y 
x >= y # x is greater than or equal to y 
x <= y # x is less than or equal to y 
Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python symbols are different from the mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single equal sign (=) instead of a double equal sign (==). Remember that = is an assignment operator and == is a relational operator. There is no such thing as =< or =>. 
5.3 Logical operators 
There are three logical operators: and, or, and not. The semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example, x > 0 and x < 10 is true only if x is greater than 0 and less than 10. 
n%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0 is true if either of the conditions is true, that is, if the number is divisible by 2 or 3. 
Finally, the not operator negates a boolean expression, so not (x > y) is true if x > y is false, that is, if x is less than or equal to y. 
Strictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be boolean expressions, but Python is not very strict. Any nonzero number is interpreted as “true.” >>> 17 and True 
True 
This flexibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to it that might be confusing. You might want to avoid it (unless you know what you are doing). 
5.4 Conditional execution 
In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. Conditional statements give us this ability. The simplest form is the if statement: 
if x > 0: 
print 'x is positive' 
The boolean expression after if is called the condition. If it is true, then the indented statement gets executed. If not, nothing happens. 
if statements have the same structure as function definitions: a header followed by an indented body. Statements like this are called compound statements. 
There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the body, but there has to be at least one. Occasionally, it is useful to have a body with no statements (usually as a place keeper for code you haven’t written yet). In that case, you can use the pass statement, which does nothing. 
if x < 0: 
pass # need to handle negative values!
5.5. Alternative execution 43 5.5 Alternative execution 
A second form of the if statement is alternative execution, in which there are two possi bilities and the condition determines which one gets executed. The syntax looks like this: 
if x%2 == 0: 
print 'x is even' 
else: 
print 'x is odd' 
If the remainder when x is divided by 2 is 0, then we know that x is even, and the program displays a message to that effect. If the condition is false, the second set of statements is executed. Since the condition must be true or false, exactly one of the alternatives will be executed. The alternatives are called branches, because they are branches in the flow of execution. 
5.6 Chained conditionals 
Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. One way to express a computation like that is a chained conditional: 
if x < y: 
print 'x is less than y' 
elif x > y: 
print 'x is greater than y' 
else: 
print 'x and y are equal' 
elif is an abbreviation of “else if.” Again, exactly one branch will be executed. There is no limit on the number of elif statements. If there is an else clause, it has to be at the end, but there doesn’t have to be one. 
if choice == 'a': 
draw_a() 
elif choice == 'b': 
draw_b() 
elif choice == 'c': 
draw_c() 
Each condition is checked in order. If the first is false, the next is checked, and so on. If one of them is true, the corresponding branch executes, and the statement ends. Even if more than one condition is true, only the first true branch executes. 
5.7 Nested conditionals 
One conditional can also be nested within another. We could have written the trichotomy example like this: 
if x == y: 
print 'x and y are equal' 
else: 
if x < y:
44 Chapter 5. Conditionals and recursion 
print 'x is less than y' 
else: 
print 'x is greater than y' 
The outer conditional contains two branches. The first branch contains a simple statement. The second branch contains another if statement, which has two branches of its own. Those two branches are both simple statements, although they could have been conditional statements as well. 
Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, nested condi tionals become difficult to read very quickly. In general, it is a good idea to avoid them when you can. 
Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional statements. For ex ample, we can rewrite the following code using a single conditional: if 0 < x: 
if x < 10: 
print 'x is a positive single-digit number.' 
The print statement is executed only if we make it past both conditionals, so we can get the same effect with the and operator: 
if 0 < x and x < 10: 
print 'x is a positive single-digit number.' 
5.8 Recursion 
It is legal for one function to call another; it is also legal for a function to call itself. It may not be obvious why that is a good thing, but it turns out to be one of the most magical things a program can do. For example, look at the following function: def countdown(n): 
if n <= 0: 
print 'Blastoff!' 
else: 
print n 
countdown(n-1) 
If n is 0 or negative, it outputs the word, “Blastoff!” Otherwise, it outputs n and then calls a function named countdown—itself—passing n-1 as an argument. 
What happens if we call this function like this? 
>>> countdown(3) 
The execution of countdown begins with n=3, and since n is greater than 0, it outputs the value 3, and then calls itself... 
The execution of countdown begins with n=2, and since n is greater than 0, it outputs the value 2, and then calls itself... 
The execution of countdown begins with n=1, and since n is greater than 0, it outputs the value 1, and then calls itself... 
The execution of countdown begins with n=0, and since n is 
not greater than 0, it outputs the word, “Blastoff!” and then 
returns.
5.9. Stack diagrams for recursive functions 45 
The countdown that got n=1 returns. 
The countdown that got n=2 returns. 
The countdown that got n=3 returns. 
And then you’re back in __main__. So, the total output looks like this: 
3 
2 
1 
Blastoff! 
A function that calls itself is recursive; the process is called recursion. 
As another example, we can write a function that prints a string n times. 
def print_n(s, n): 
if n <= 0: 
return 
print s 
print_n(s, n-1) 
If n <= 0 the return statement exits the function. The flow of execution immediately re turns to the caller, and the remaining lines of the function are not executed. 
The rest of the function is similar to countdown: if n is greater than 0, it displays s and then calls itself to display s n − 1 additional times. So the number of lines of output is 1 + (n - 1), which adds up to n. 
For simple examples like this, it is probably easier to use a for loop. But we will see examples later that are hard to write with a for loop and easy to write with recursion, so it is good to start early. 
5.9 Stack diagrams for recursive functions 
In Section 3.10, we used a stack diagram to represent the state of a program during a func tion call. The same kind of diagram can help interpret a recursive function. 
Every time a function gets called, Python creates a new function frame, which contains the function’s local variables and parameters. For a recursive function, there might be more than one frame on the stack at the same time. 
Figure 5.1 shows a stack diagram for countdown called with n = 3. 
As usual, the top of the stack is the frame for __main__. It is empty because we did not create any variables in __main__ or pass any arguments to it. 
The four countdown frames have different values for the parameter n. The bottom of the stack, where n=0, is called the base case. It does not make a recursive call, so there are no more frames. 
Exercise 5.1. Draw a stack diagram for print_n called with s = 'Hello' and n=2. Exercise 5.2. Write a function called do_n that takes a function object and a number, n, as argu ments, and that calls the given function n times.
46 Chapter 5. Conditionals and recursion <module> 
countdown countdown countdown countdown 
n 3 n 2 n 1 n 0 
Figure 5.1: Stack diagram. 
5.10 Infinite recursion 
If a recursion never reaches a base case, it goes on making recursive calls forever, and the program never terminates. This is known as infinite recursion, and it is generally not a good idea. Here is a minimal program with an infinite recursion: 
def recurse(): 
recurse() 
In most programming environments, a program with infinite recursion does not really run forever. Python reports an error message when the maximum recursion depth is reached: 
File "<stdin>", line 2, in recurse 
File "<stdin>", line 2, in recurse 
File "<stdin>", line 2, in recurse 
. 
. 
. 
File "<stdin>", line 2, in recurse 
RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded 
This traceback is a little bigger than the one we saw in the previous chapter. When the error occurs, there are 1000 recurse frames on the stack! 
5.11 Keyboard input 
The programs we have written so far are a bit rude in the sense that they accept no input from the user. They just do the same thing every time. 
Python 2 provides a built-in function called raw_input that gets input from the keyboard. In Python 3, it is called input. When this function is called, the program stops and waits for the user to type something. When the user presses Return or Enter, the program resumes and raw_input returns what the user typed as a string. 
>>> text = raw_input() 
What are you waiting for? 
>>> print text 
What are you waiting for?
5.12. Debugging 47 
Before getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a prompt telling the user what to input. raw_input can take a prompt as an argument: 
>>> name = raw_input('What...is your name?\n') 
What...is your name? 
Arthur, King of the Britons! 
>>> print name 
Arthur, King of the Britons! 
The sequence \n at the end of the prompt represents a newline, which is a special character that causes a line break. That’s why the user’s input appears below the prompt. 
If you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert the return value to int: 
>>> prompt = 'What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n' >>> speed = raw_input(prompt) 
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? 
17 
>>> int(speed) 
17 
But if the user types something other than a string of digits, you get an error: 
>>> speed = raw_input(prompt) 
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? 
What do you mean, an African or a European swallow? 
>>> int(speed) 
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10 
We will see how to handle this kind of error later. 
5.12 Debugging 
The traceback Python displays when an error occurs contains a lot of information, but it can be overwhelming, especially when there are many frames on the stack. The most useful parts are usually: 
• What kind of error it was, and 
• Where it occurred. 
Syntax errors are usually easy to find, but there are a few gotchas. Whitespace errors can be tricky because spaces and tabs are invisible and we are used to ignoring them. 
>>> x = 5 
>>> y = 6 
File "<stdin>", line 1 
y = 6 
^ 
IndentationError: unexpected indent 
In this example, the problem is that the second line is indented by one space. But the error message points to y, which is misleading. In general, error messages indicate where the problem was discovered, but the actual error might be earlier in the code, sometimes on a previous line.
48 Chapter 5. Conditionals and recursion 
The same is true of runtime errors. 
Suppose you are trying to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels. The formula is SNRdb = 10 log10(Psignal/Pnoise). In Python, you might write something like this: import math 
signal_power = 9 
noise_power = 10 
ratio = signal_power / noise_power 
decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio) 
print decibels 
But when you run it in Python 2, you get an error message. 
Traceback (most recent call last): 
File "snr.py", line 5, in ? 
decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio) 
ValueError: math domain error 
The error message indicates line 5, but there is nothing wrong with that line. To find the real error, it might be useful to print the value of ratio, which turns out to be 0. The problem is in line 4, because dividing two integers does floor division. The solution is to represent signal power and noise power with floating-point values. 
In general, error messages tell you where the problem was discovered, but that is often not where it was caused. 
In Python 3, this example does not cause an error; the division operator performs floating point division even with integer operands.

5.14 Exercises 
Exercise 5.3. Fermat’s Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers a, b, and c such that 
an + bn = cn 
for any values of n greater than 2. 
1. Write a function named check_fermat that takes four parameters—a, b, c and n—and that checks to see if Fermat’s theorem holds. If n is greater than 2 and it turns out to be true that 
an + bn = cn 
the program should print, “Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!” Otherwise the program should print, “No, that doesn’t work.” 
2. Write a function that prompts the user to input values for a, b, c and n, converts them to integers, and uses check_fermat to check whether they violate Fermat’s theorem. 
Exercise 5.4. If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange them in a triangle. For example, if one of the sticks is 12 inches long and the other two are one inch long, it is clear that you will not be able to get the short sticks to meet in the middle. For any three lengths, there is a simple test to see if it is possible to form a triangle: 
If any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two, then you cannot form a triangle. Otherwise, you can. (If the sum of two lengths equals the third, they form what is called a “degenerate” triangle.) 
1. Write a function named is_triangle that takes three integers as arguments, and that prints either “Yes” or “No,” depending on whether you can or cannot form a triangle from sticks with the given lengths. 
2. Write a function that prompts the user to input three stick lengths, converts them to integers, and uses is_triangle to check whether sticks with the given lengths can form a triangle.

Fruitful functions 
6.1 Return values 
Some of the built-in functions we have used, such as the math functions, produce results. Calling the function generates a value, which we usually assign to a variable or use as part of an expression. 
e = math.exp(1.0) 
height = radius * math.sin(radians) 
All of the functions we have written so far are void; they print something or move turtles around, but their return value is None. 
In this chapter, we are (finally) going to write fruitful functions. The first example is area, which returns the area of a circle with the given radius: 
def area(radius): 
temp = math.pi * radius**2 
return temp 
We have seen the return statement before, but in a fruitful function the return statement includes an expression. This statement means: “Return immediately from this function and use the following expression as a return value.” The expression can be arbitrarily complicated, so we could have written this function more concisely: 
def area(radius): 
return math.pi * radius**2 
On the other hand, temporary variables like temp often make debugging easier. 
Sometimes it is useful to have multiple return statements, one in each branch of a condi tional: 
def absolute_value(x): 
if x < 0: 
return -x 
else: 
return x
52 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions 
Since these return statements are in an alternative conditional, only one will be executed. 
As soon as a return statement executes, the function terminates without executing any subsequent statements. Code that appears after a return statement, or any other place the flow of execution can never reach, is called dead code. 
In a fruitful function, it is a good idea to ensure that every possible path through the pro gram hits a return statement. For example: 
def absolute_value(x): 
if x < 0: 
return -x 
if x > 0: 
return x 
This function is incorrect because if x happens to be 0, neither condition is true, and the function ends without hitting a return statement. If the flow of execution gets to the end of a function, the return value is None, which is not the absolute value of 0. 
>>> print absolute_value(0) 
None 
By the way, Python provides a built-in function called abs that computes absolute values. Exercise 6.1. Write a compare function that returns 1 if x > y, 0 if x == y, and -1 if x < y. 
6.2 Incremental development 
As you write larger functions, you might find yourself spending more time debugging. 
To deal with increasingly complex programs, you might want to try a process called in cremental development. The goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time. 
As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points, given by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is: 
q 
distance = 
(x2 − x1)2 + (y2 − y1)2 
The first step is to consider what a distance function should look like in Python. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)? 
In this case, the inputs are two points, which you can represent using four numbers. The return value is the distance, which is a floating-point value. 
Already you can write an outline of the function: 
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2): 
return 0.0 
Obviously, this version doesn’t compute distances; it always returns zero. But it is syn tactically correct, and it runs, which means that you can test it before you make it more complicated. 
To test the new function, call it with sample arguments:
6.2. Incremental development 53 
>>> distance(1, 2, 4, 6) 
0.0 
I chose these values so that the horizontal distance is 3 and the vertical distance is 4; that way, the result is 5 (the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle). When testing a function, it is useful to know the right answer. 
At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and we can start adding code to the body. A reasonable next step is to find the differences x2 − x1 and y2 − y1. The next version stores those values in temporary variables and prints them. def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2): 
dx = x2 - x1 
dy = y2 - y1 
print 'dx is', dx 
print 'dy is', dy 
return 0.0 
If the function is working, it should display 'dx is 3' and 'dy is 4'. If so, we know that the function is getting the right arguments and performing the first computation correctly. If not, there are only a few lines to check. 
Next we compute the sum of squares of dx and dy: 
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2): 
dx = x2 - x1 
dy = y2 - y1 
dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2 
print 'dsquared is: ', dsquared 
return 0.0 
Again, you would run the program at this stage and check the output (which should be 25). Finally, you can use math.sqrt to compute and return the result: 
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2): 
dx = x2 - x1 
dy = y2 - y1 
dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2 
result = math.sqrt(dsquared) 
return result 
If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to print the value of result before the return statement. 
The final version of the function doesn’t display anything when it runs; it only returns a value. The print statements we wrote are useful for debugging, but once you get the function working, you should remove them. Code like that is called scaffolding because it is helpful for building the program but is not part of the final product. 
When you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a time. As you gain more experience, you might find yourself writing and debugging bigger chunks. Either way, incremental development can save you a lot of debugging time. 
The key aspects of the process are: 
1. Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.
54 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions 
2. Use temporary variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them. 
3. Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does not make the program difficult to read. 
Exercise 6.2. Use incremental development to write a function called hypotenuse that returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the two legs as arguments. Record each stage of the development process as you go. 
6.3 Composition 
As you should expect by now, you can call one function from within another. This ability is called composition. 
As an example, we’ll write a function that takes two points, the center of the circle and a point on the perimeter, and computes the area of the circle. 
Assume that the center point is stored in the variables xc and yc, and the perimeter point is in xp and yp. The first step is to find the radius of the circle, which is the distance between the two points. We just wrote a function, distance, that does that: 
radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp) 
The next step is to find the area of a circle with that radius; we just wrote that, too: result = area(radius) 
Encapsulating these steps in a function, we get: 
def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp): 
radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp) 
result = area(radius) 
return result 
The temporary variables radius and result are useful for development and debugging, but once the program is working, we can make it more concise by composing the function calls: 
def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp): 
return area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)) 
6.4 Boolean functions 
Functions can return booleans, which is often convenient for hiding complicated tests in side functions. For example: 
def is_divisible(x, y): 
if x % y == 0: 
return True 
else: 
return False
6.5. More recursion 55 
It is common to give boolean functions names that sound like yes/no questions; is_divisible returns either True or False to indicate whether x is divisible by y. 
Here is an example: 
>>> is_divisible(6, 4) 
False 
>>> is_divisible(6, 3) 
True 
The result of the == operator is a boolean, so we can write the function more concisely by returning it directly: 
def is_divisible(x, y): 
return x % y == 0 
Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements: 
if is_divisible(x, y): 
print 'x is divisible by y' 
It might be tempting to write something like: 
if is_divisible(x, y) == True: 
print 'x is divisible by y' 
But the extra comparison is unnecessary. 
Exercise 6.3. Write a function is_between(x, y, z) that returns True if x ≤ y ≤ z or False otherwise. 
6.5 More recursion 
We have only covered a small subset of Python, but you might be interested to know that this subset is a complete programming language, which means that anything that can be computed can be expressed in this language. Any program ever written could be rewritten using only the language features you have learned so far (actually, you would need a few commands to control devices like the keyboard, mouse, disks, etc., but that’s all). 
Proving that claim is a nontrivial exercise first accomplished by Alan Turing, one of the first computer scientists (some would argue that he was a mathematician, but a lot of early computer scientists started as mathematicians). Accordingly, it is known as the Turing Thesis. For a more complete (and accurate) discussion of the Turing Thesis, I recommend Michael Sipser’s book Introduction to the Theory of Computation. 
To give you an idea of what you can do with the tools you have learned so far, we’ll eval uate a few recursively defined mathematical functions. A recursive definition is similar to a circular definition, in the sense that the definition contains a reference to the thing being defined. A truly circular definition is not very useful: 
vorpal: An adjective used to describe something that is vorpal. 
If you saw that definition in the dictionary, you might be annoyed. On the other hand, if you looked up the definition of the factorial function, denoted with the symbol !, you might get something like this: 
0! = 1 
n! = n(n − 1)!
56 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions 
This definition says that the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of any other value, n, is n multiplied by the factorial of n − 1. 
So 3! is 3 times 2!, which is 2 times 1!, which is 1 times 0!. Putting it all together, 3! equals 3 times 2 times 1 times 1, which is 6. 
If you can write a recursive definition of something, you can usually write a Python pro gram to evaluate it. The first step is to decide what the parameters should be. In this case it should be clear that factorial takes an integer: 
def factorial(n): 
If the argument happens to be 0, all we have to do is return 1: 
def factorial(n): 
if n == 0: 
return 1 
Otherwise, and this is the interesting part, we have to make a recursive call to find the factorial of n − 1 and then multiply it by n: 
def factorial(n): 
if n == 0: 
return 1 
else: 
recurse = factorial(n-1) 
result = n * recurse 
return result 
The flow of execution for this program is similar to the flow of countdown in Section 5.8. If we call factorial with the value 3: 
Since 3 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of n-1... 
Since 2 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of n-1... 
Since 1 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of n-1... 
Since 0 is 0, we take the first branch and return 1 without 
making any more recursive calls. 
The return value (1) is multiplied by n, which is 1, and the result is returned. 
The return value (1) is multiplied by n, which is 2, and the result is returned. 
The return value (2) is multiplied by n, which is 3, and the result, 6, becomes the return value of the function call that started the whole process. 
Figure 6.1 shows what the stack diagram looks like for this sequence of function calls. 
The return values are shown being passed back up the stack. In each frame, the return value is the value of result, which is the product of n and recurse. 
In the last frame, the local variables recurse and result do not exist, because the branch that creates them does not execute.

6.6 Leap of faith 
Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but it can quickly become labyrinthine. An alternative is what I call the “leap of faith.” When you come to a function call, instead of following the flow of execution, you assume that the function works correctly and returns the right result. 
In fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use built-in functions. When you call math.cos or math.exp, you don’t examine the bodies of those functions. You just assume that they work because the people who wrote the built-in functions were good programmers. 
The same is true when you call one of your own functions. For example, in Section 6.4, we wrote a function called is_divisible that determines whether one number is divisible by another. Once we have convinced ourselves that this function is correct—by examining the code and testing—we can use the function without looking at the body again. 
The same is true of recursive programs. When you get to the recursive call, instead of following the flow of execution, you should assume that the recursive call works (yields the correct result) and then ask yourself, “Assuming that I can find the factorial of n − 1, can I compute the factorial of n?” In this case, it is clear that you can, by multiplying by n. 
Of course, it’s a bit strange to assume that the function works correctly when you haven’t finished writing it, but that’s why it’s called a leap of faith! 
6.7 One more example 
After factorial, the most common example of a recursively defined mathematical func tion is fibonacci, which has the following definition (see http://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Fibonacci_number): 
fibonacci(0) = 0 
fibonacci(1) = 1 
fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n − 1) + fibonacci(n − 2) 
Translated into Python, it looks like this:
58 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions 
def fibonacci (n): 
if n == 0: 
return 0 
elif n == 1: 
return 1 
else: 
return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) 
If you try to follow the flow of execution here, even for fairly small values of n, your head explodes. But according to the leap of faith, if you assume that the two recursive calls work correctly, then it is clear that you get the right result by adding them together. 
6.8 Checking types 
What happens if we call factorial and give it 1.5 as an argument? 
>>> factorial(1.5) 
RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded 
It looks like an infinite recursion. But how can that be? There is a base case—when n == 0. But if n is not an integer, we can miss the base case and recurse forever. 
In the first recursive call, the value of n is 0.5. In the next, it is -0.5. From there, it gets smaller (more negative), but it will never be 0. 
We have two choices. We can try to generalize the factorial function to work with floating-point numbers, or we can make factorial check the type of its argument. The first option is called the gamma function and it’s a little beyond the scope of this book. So we’ll go for the second. 
We can use the built-in function isinstance to verify the type of the argument. While we’re at it, we can also make sure the argument is positive: 
def factorial (n): 
if not isinstance(n, int): 
print 'Factorial is only defined for integers.' 
return None 
elif n < 0: 
print 'Factorial is not defined for negative integers.' 
return None 
elif n == 0: 
return 1 
else: 
return n * factorial(n-1) 
The first base case handles nonintegers; the second catches negative integers. In both cases, the program prints an error message and returns None to indicate that something went wrong: 
>>> factorial('fred') 
Factorial is only defined for integers. 
None 
>>> factorial(-2) 
Factorial is not defined for negative integers. 
None
